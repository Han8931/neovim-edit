# NeoVim Integration for Obsidian

This plugin allows you to seamlessly use NeoVim to edit your notes within Obsidian, combining the power of NeoVim's text editing capabilities with Obsidian's note-taking and knowledge management features.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration:** Open your current note in NeoVim with a simple command or shortcut (`Ctrl+Alt o`), making your editing workflow faster and more efficient.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo and put the entire directory under your `<vault>/plugins/`
2. Toggle the plugin (community plugins in the settings) 

## Usage

To edit your current note in NeoVim, use the following steps:

1. Open the note you wish to edit in Obsidian.
2. Press `Ctrl+Alt o`. Your note will open in NeoVim. Make your edits as needed.
3. Save your changes in NeoVim. The edited content will automatically update in Obsidian.

## Configuration
Change the `terminalCommand` in `main.js` to your default terminal. In my case, my default terminal is `simple terminal (st)`.
